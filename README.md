# Brynn Harris-Shanks

## Hello!
I am a third year Neuroscience major at [Dalhousie University](dal.ca) in Halifax, NS. I am currently taking Neural Data Science (NESC 3505) to strengthn my coding skills and to apply them current and future projects. This course also counts towards the Certificate in Neurotehnology and Innovation that I am completing. In this course we have worked with Pandas, Seaborn, and MatPlotLib to visualize, explore, and understand data from a single neuron, EEG, and MRI. This portfolio will outline some of my work and demonstrate my coding skills.

## Code Snippets:
* To start things off, click [here](reading_files2.md) to take a look at my code from assignment 3 where I read a files and merge multiple files into one DataFrame.

* Check out how I [cleaned data](cleaning_data.md) in assignment 1 and 3.

* In assignment 3 I visualized data from a flanker experiment with Pandas and Seaborn [histograms](plotting_data.md).

* Over the couple weeks we have learned about managing data from single units. [Here](single_unit.md) is how I extracted and plotted data from a single neuron.
